// Mongoose Middleware Docs: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html
// I'm going to set up a Mongoose middleware and we need to do this on the schema before we compile the actual
// model. This is where it gets more complicated because I have to decide if I'm doing a pre or post middleware.
// If we go back to the middleware docs and we look at findOneAndDelete(), which is what we're
// going to be working with, it is a query middleware, not a model or document middleware. That distinction
// is important, but we're not going to go into it at this point. All that I'll say is that, well, they tell
// you right here in a query middleware function, 'this' refers to the query versus in a document middleware
// function 'this' refers to the document. When we set up our middleware and it's a query middleware
// which ours has to be, it's just that's what findOneAndDelete() is, WE NEED TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER our query
// has completed so that we have access to the document that was found.
